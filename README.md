# 🕵️‍♂️ Anonymous Crime Reporting System (Blockchain-Based)
Anonymous Crime Reporting System is a decentralized web application designed to empower individuals to report crimes securely and anonymously using blockchain technology. In many societies, fear of retaliation or lack of trust in law enforcement discourages people from coming forward. This project eliminates that fear by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain (Sepolia Testnet), cryptography, and a user-friendly web interface to ensure that reports are:

Anonymous – No personal data is collected or stored

Immutable – Reports cannot be tampered with once submitted

Transparent – Every report is verifiable on the blockchain

The frontend is built using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a modern and intuitive user experience. On the backend, Solidity smart contracts handle report storage and verification on the blockchain, while Node.js manages interaction with the network and off-chain operations. Additional cryptographic techniques ensure the privacy and integrity of every submission.
